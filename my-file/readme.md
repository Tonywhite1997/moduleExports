I created two folders named friend-file and my-file
I created about my friend object and added it to module object for export.
I created about me object and imported my friend's folder into my own file so that I can use my friend's information.
I then wrote a function(talkAboutMe) to return a little about me and using some information from my friend file that I imported.
I invoked the function on the last line.
in another file called app.js, i exported my-file and destructured out the function that talked about me and log out the information.
